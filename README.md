This project aims to produce a formal specification of [REBOL][1] syntax. The
method of specification used is REBOL 3's variant of the [PARSE dialect][2].

This project is very much a work in progress. So be aware that many datatypes
or lexical intricacies are missing. What already exists may as well be buggy or
even flat out wrong.

Patches and suggestions are very much welcome.
